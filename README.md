# Anomaly Detection in IoT Data

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in IoT sensor data to identify abnormal behavior such as data acquisition errors, unexpected spikes, or irregular patterns. Multiple anomaly detection models are applied and evaluated to distinguish normal observations from anomalies.

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and common data science libraries. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model application, and result interpretation to support reliable monitoring of IoT systems.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features
- IoT data preprocessing and exploration
- Application of anomaly detection models
- Visualization of anomalies and trends
- Insight into data quality and system behavior

## Usage
Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
